基于AR kit和Reality kit实现的图片铆钉显示虚拟模型Demo项目， Combine实现异步通信机制。项目中也使用了单例模式。

This is my AR Demo based on Apple's ARkit and Realitykit, Combine is used to implement a-synchronization with button. And I use the singleton pattern. You can try place the models on the plane anchor.

Now I adjusted the main anchor to an Image, you can easily alter the code to plane anchor.
